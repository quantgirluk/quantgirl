Greeks) using Malliavin Calculus + Monte Carlo methods, thoroughly exploring its mathematical formulation, along with a practical demonstration of its implementation in Python. 🐍&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the points that we discussed during the session:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I shared a bit about my experience working as a Quant after graduating from a STEM background (and having no previous experience).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More generally, we discussed what does it mean to be a Quant and how this has changed over the years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We talked about the large number of opportunities that currently exist in the Quant world. To put things in perspective, we took a look at this image from the book “The Front Office Manual: The Definitive Guide to Trading, Structuring and Sales (Global Financial Markets) (2013)” by A. Sutherland, and J. Court; and commented on how much things have changed since the book was published. Today, the picture should probably look more like this one ⬇️ which translates in much more opportunities for Quants!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then, we passed to the more technical part of the agenda: defining the problem of estimating Greeks and exploring different mathematical techniques to solve it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
