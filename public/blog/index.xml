      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, we focused on the problem of estimating price sensitivities (a.k.a. Greeks) using Malliavin Calculus + Monte Carlo methods, thoroughly exploring its mathematical formulation, along with a practical demonstration of its implementation in Python. üêç&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the points that we discussed during the session:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I shared a bit about my experience working as a Quant after graduating from a STEM background (and having no previous experience).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More generally, we discussed what does it mean to be a Quant and how this has changed over the years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We talked about the large number of opportunities that currently exist in the Quant world. To put things in perspective, we took a look at this image from the book ‚ÄúThe Front Office Manual: The Definitive Guide to Trading, Structuring and Sales (Global Financial Markets) (2013)‚Äù by A. Sutherland, and J. Court; and commented on how much things have changed since the book was published. Today, the picture should probably look more like this one ‚¨áÔ∏è which translates in much more opportunities for Quants!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then, we passed to the more technical part of the agenda: defining the problem of estimating Greeks and exploring different mathematical techniques to solve it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can access the lecture materials in the provided Jupyter notebook and slides here.&#xA;Jupyter Notebook: Malliavin Greeks under BS dynamics&lt;/p&gt;</description>
